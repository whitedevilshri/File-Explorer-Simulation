File Explorer Simulation (DSA Project)

This project is a virtual file explorer built to understand and implement core
Data Structures and Algorithms used in real-world systems.

Current Progress (Phase 1 - Core Logic Test)
- Created folder and subfolder structure using Tree data structure
- Implemented file creation inside folders
- Added back navigation using Stack
- Maintained current directory pointer

Data Structures Used
- Tree (Folder hierarchy)
- Stack (Back navigation)
- List (File storage)
- String (Naming and search foundation)

Tech Stack
- Java
- Core DSA concepts

Next Steps
- Menu-driven console interface
- Directory tree visualization (DFS/BFS)
- File & folder search
- Deletion operations
